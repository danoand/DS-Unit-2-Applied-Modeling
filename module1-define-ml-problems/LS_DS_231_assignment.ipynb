    "- [x] Is your problem regression or classification?\n",
    "- [x] How is your target distributed?\n",
    "    - Classification: How many classes? Are the classes imbalanced?\n",
    "    - Regression: Is the target right-skewed? If so, you may want to log transform the target.\n",
    "- [x] Choose your evaluation metric(s).\n",
    "    - Classification: Is your majority class frequency >= 50% and < 70% ? If so, you can just use accuracy if you want. Outside that range, accuracy could be misleading. What evaluation metric will you choose, in addition to or instead of accuracy?\n",
    "    - Regression: Will you use mean absolute error, root mean squared error, R^2, or other regression metrics?\n",
    "- [x] Choose which observations you will use to train, validate, and test your model.\n",
    "    - Are some observations outliers? Will you exclude them?\n",
    "    - Will you do a random split or a time-based split?\n",
